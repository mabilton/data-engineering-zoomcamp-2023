# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023

This repository contains all the notes and code that I, Matt Bilton, wrote when taking the 2023 version of the *Data Engineering Zoomcamp*, an online introductory course on Data Engineering run by the *DataTalksClub* organisation, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub).

If you're coming across this repository 'in the wild', I recommend first checking out the [official Github repository for the course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) before looking over anything within this repository.
